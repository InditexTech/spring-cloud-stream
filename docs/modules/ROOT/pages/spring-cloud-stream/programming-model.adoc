= Programming Model

To understand the programming model, you should be familiar with the following core concepts:

* *Destination Binders:* Components responsible to provide integration with the external messaging systems.
* *Bindings:* Bridge between the external messaging systems and application provided _Producers_ and _Consumers_ of messages (created by the Destination Binders).
* *Message:* The canonical data structure used by producers and consumers to communicate with Destination Binders (and thus other applications via external messaging systems).
