[[binder-detection]]
= Binder Detection

Spring Cloud Stream relies on implementations of the Binder SPI to perform the task of connecting (binding) user code to message brokers.
Each Binder implementation typically connects to one type of messaging system.

[[classpath-detection]]
== Classpath Detection

By default, Spring Cloud Stream relies on Spring Boot's auto-configuration to configure the binding process.
If a single Binder implementation is found on the classpath, Spring Cloud Stream automatically uses it.
For example, a Spring Cloud Stream project that aims to bind only to RabbitMQ can add the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-stream-binder-rabbit</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

For the specific Maven coordinates of other binder dependencies, see the documentation of that binder implementation.
