:page-section-summary-toc: 1

Kafka Streams binder provides the following actuator endpoints for retrieving the topology description using which you can visualize the topology using external tools.

`/actuator/kafkastreamstopology`

`/actuator/kafkastreamstopology/<application-id of the processor>`

You need to include the actuator and web dependencies from Spring Boot to access these endpoints.
Further, you also need to add `kafkastreamstopology` to `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` property.
By default, the `kafkastreamstopology` endpoint is disabled.
