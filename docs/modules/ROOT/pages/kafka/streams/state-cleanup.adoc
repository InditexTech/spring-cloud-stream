[[state-cleanup]]
= State Cleanup

By default, no local state is cleaned up when the binding is stopped.
This is the same behavior effective from Spring Kafka version 2.7.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/reference/html/#streams-config[Spring Kafka documentation] for more details.
To modify this behavior simply add a single `CleanupConfig` `@Bean` (configured to clean up on start, stop, or neither) to the application context; the bean will be detected and wired into the factory bean.
