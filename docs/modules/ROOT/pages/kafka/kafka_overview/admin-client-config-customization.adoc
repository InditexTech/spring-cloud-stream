= Customizing AdminClient Configuration
:page-section-summary-toc: 1

As with consumer and producer config customization above, applications can also customize the configuration for admin clients by providing an `AdminClientConfigCustomizer`.
AdminClientConfigCustomizer's configure method provides access to the admin client properties, using which you can define further customization.
Binder's Kafka topic provisioner gives the highest precedence for the properties given through this customizer.
Here is an example of providing this customizer bean.

```
@Bean
public AdminClientConfigCustomizer adminClientConfigCustomizer() {
    return props -> {
        props.put(CommonClientConfigs.SECURITY_PROTOCOL_CONFIG, "SASL_SSL");
    };
}
```
