[[multiplex]]
= Multiplex

Starting with version 4.0.3, the common consumer property `multiplex` is now supported by the reactive binder, where a single binding can consume from multiple topics.
When `false` (default), a separate binding is created for each topic specified in a comma-delimited list in the common `destination` property.
