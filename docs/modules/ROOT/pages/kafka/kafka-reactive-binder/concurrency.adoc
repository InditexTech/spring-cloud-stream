[[concurrency]]
= Concurrency

When using reactive functions with the reactive Kafka binder, if you set concurrency on the consumer binding, then the binder creates as many dedicated `KafkaReceiver` objects as provided by the concurrency value.
In other words, this creates multiple reactive streams with separate `Flux` implementations.
This could be useful when you are consuming records from a partitioned topic.

For example, assume that the incoming topic has at least three partitions.
Then you can set the following property.

```
spring.cloud.stream.bindings.lowercase-in-0.consumer.concurrency=3
```

That will create three dedicated `KafkaReceiver` objects that generate three separate `Flux` implementations and then stream them to the handler method.
